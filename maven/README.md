# AOSS-SpringBoot-Sample-Starter-Project using Maven

Follow the following steps if you are using Maven as build automation tool for your Java project.

You should have Java and Maven downloaded and configured on your system. You can verify their installations by running java -version and mvn --version in the command prompt or terminal.

After cloning move to Maven folder and follow the steps mentioned below to start working on the project.

## Steps to start working on project
1. User should run setup.sh script before doing anything,in order to run and check the installation and authentication on their system. The script will guide them what went wrong and it is mandatory to run this before starting build tool. Run the following command after inserting path_to_service_account_key to execute the setup script:

```cmd
chmod +x setup.sh 
./setup.sh path_to_service_account_key
```
Once the setup is completed it will say "Authentication successful, Proceed with mvn clean install"
Refer to [set up authentication](https://cloud.google.com/assured-open-source-software/docs/validate-connection#set_up_authentication) for further information.

2. After the setup is complete the user should run 

```cmd
mvn clean install
```
to download required packages
 
3. In case user want to look at the report of what packages are downloaded from Assured OSS and Open Source as well, they can run generate_report.sh script after inserting path_to_service_account_key to execute the setup script

```cmd
chmod +x generate_report.sh
./generate_report.sh path_to_service_account_key
```
The following report will be printed as report.txt

## Steps to make changes and extend the project 

1. The current pom.xml files contain packages required for the application to run, Users can add more packages by adding <dependency> tag to the file. Available packages will get downloaded from Asurred OSS and rest from open-source.

```cmd
<dependencies>

    <dependency>
      
    </dependency>
	
  </dependencies>
```

2. Upgrade the Java SDK version according to system requirements by changing the properties section of pom.xml file

```cmd
<properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
```

3. Run the following command to install the packages and run the application:

```cmd
mvn clean install
```


All the required packages will get downloaded, and users can import it to start working with it. 
You have the basic framework to start working with SpringBoot Application along with the Logging library, to see output which is “Hello,World”, open localhost:8080/hello.

In case you get stuck in any process refer to [Download Java packages using direct repository access](https://cloud.google.com/assured-open-source-software/docs/download-java-packages#access_packages_not_available_in_assured_oss).


## Additional Information

Ideally it is preferred to use authentication using credential helper but user can also authenticate using service key : 

### Setting up authentication via service Key:

Users have to replace the KEY present in settings.xml file, with the base64-encoding of the entire service account JSON key file. To do this, execute following command:

```cmd
cat KEY_FILE_LOCATION | base64
```
Where KEY_FILE_LOCATION is the location of the service account JSON key file.

### Updating settings.xml file:

If the settings file already exists in ~/. m2/  location for linux and ${user. home}/. m2 location for mac, user can directly update the settings.xml file, if not user has to create the settings.xml file

Replace the {KEY} value in the settings.xml file :


```cmd
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>artifact-registry</id>
      <configuration>
        <httpConfiguration>
          <get>
            <usePreemptive>true</usePreemptive>
          </get>
          <head>
            <usePreemptive>true</usePreemptive>
          </head>
          <put>
            <params>
              <property>
                <name>http.protocol.expect-continue</name>
                <value>false</value>
              </property>
            </params>
          </put>
        </httpConfiguration>
      </configuration>
      <username>_json_key_base64</username>
      <password>{KEY}</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

Run the following command :

```cmd
mvn -s settings.xml clean install
```
Refer to [Authenticate using password](https://cloud.google.com/assured-open-source-software/docs/download-java-packages#authenticate_using_password) for further information.
